# Overview
Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive tool to visualize and understand the functioning of various sorting algorithms. This project is designed to provide an educational experience by animating the step-by-step process of popular sorting techniques, making it easier to comprehend their inner workings.

## Features
- Visualize popular sorting algorithms such as:
  * Bubble Sort
  * Selection Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Heap Sort
- Adjustable array size and sorting speed.
- Randomize the dataset to test algorithms with varying inputs.
- Real-time animation of sorting processes.
- Responsive and intuitive user interface.
